## tips-calc.py

# Instructions

A program to calculate a tip percentage and bill shared among a certain number of people

If the bill was $150.00, split between 5 people, with 12% tip.
Each person should pay (150.00 / 5) \* 1.12 = 33.6
Format the result to 2 decimal places = 33.60
Thus everyone's share of the total bill is $30.00 plus a $3.60 tip.
